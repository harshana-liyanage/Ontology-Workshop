# Ontology Building Challenge

## Step 1 - Create WebProtoge accounts

1. Visit the WebProtoge website and create an account. \(Make sure you use an email address which you have access during the workshop\)  [https://webprotege.stanford.edu](https://webprotege.stanford.edu)
2. Write your **username** in paper given to your teams  

### Step 2- Concept Identification

We will be building an ontology about Atrial Fibrillation

1. Assign a category of concepts to each team member

           Categories:

           a. Symptoms

           b. Risk factors  
           c. Diagnosis  
           d. Therapy

2. Use references given or online sources to identify concepts for these categories

### Step 3 - Build the ontology

Add the concepts that you have found to the upper level structure given.

### Step 4 - Annotate the ontology with clinical codes

Find suitable codes here: [https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/)
