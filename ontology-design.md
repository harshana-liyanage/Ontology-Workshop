# Ontology Design



1. Realism: the goal of an ontology is to describe reality. 
2. Perspectivalism: there are multiple accurate descriptions of reality 
3. Fallibalism: ontologies, like scientific theories, are revisable in a light of new discoveries. 
4. Adequatism: the entities in a given domain should be taken seriously on their own terms, not viewed as reducible to other kinds of entities. 
5. The Principle of Reuse: existing ontologies should be treated as benchmarks and reused whenever possible in building ontologies for new domains. 
6. The Ontology Design Process Should Balance Utility and Realism: sacrificing realism to address considerations of short-term utility when building an ontology may be at the detriment of ontologyâ€™s long-term utility. 
7. The Ontology Design Process Is Open Ended: scientific ontologies will always be subject to the need for update in light of advances in knowledge; ontology design, maintenance and updating is an ongoing process. 
8. The Principle of Low-Hanging Fruit: in ontology design, begin with the features of the relevant domain that are easiest to understand and define, then work outward to more complex and controversial features.
