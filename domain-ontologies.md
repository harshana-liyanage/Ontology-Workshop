# Domain Ontologies

1. Demarcate the subject matter of the ontology. 
2. Gather information: identify the general terms used in existing ontologies and in standard textbooks; analyse to remove redundancies. 
3. Order these terms in a hierarchy of the more or less general ones. 
4. Regiment the result in order to ensure: 

         -logical, philosophical, and scientific 

         -coherence, coherence and compatibility with neighbouring ontologies, and 

         -human understandability, especially through the formulation of human-readable definitions.

5. Formalize the regimented representational artefact in a computer usable language in such a way that the result can be implemented in some computable framework.
